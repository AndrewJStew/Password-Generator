# Password-Generator
An application where an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code.

## Description

This program uses Javascript prompts to ask the user for input and then generates a unqiue password from that input. This involves asking the user if they want numbers and special characters, alongside lower and uppercase letters.

To create this work I have combined functions, if statements and for loops.
